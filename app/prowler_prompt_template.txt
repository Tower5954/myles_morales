Evaluate the following contact information extracted for {{COMPANY_NAME}}:

CONTACT INFORMATION:
{{CONTACT_INFO}}

SOURCE URLs:
{{SOURCE_URL}}

Your task is to evaluate this contact information on the following ADVANCED criteria:

1. Completeness (01-99): How complete is the contact information?
   - Are phone numbers present?
   - CRITICAL INSIGHT: Multiple instances of the SAME phone number increase confidence
   - Are email addresses included and valid?
   - Is a physical address provided?
   - Is a website URL included?
   - Are social media profiles or additional contact channels listed?

2. Accuracy (01-99): How accurate does the information appear to be?
   - CRITICAL TECHNIQUE: An official website is strongly indicated if the URL contains the business name
     Example: For "Wigan Youth Zone", a URL like "https://www.wiganyouthzone.org" suggests high accuracy
   - Do the sources seem reliable?
   - Is information consistent across multiple sources?
   - Do emails match company domain patterns?
   - Do phone numbers have proper country/area codes?

3. Confidence (01-99): How confident can we be in this information?
   - Is information from primary sources (company website) or secondary?
   - Are multiple independent sources confirming the same details?
   - SPECIAL SCORING: Repeated contact details (same phone, consistent website) increase confidence
   - Is information clearly structured and formatted properly?

4. Overall Score (01-99): An overall rating of the contact information quality

IMPORTANT: 
- Your scores MUST vary based on the quality of information present
- Never use identical scores for all categories
- EXPLICITLY consider the special techniques mentioned above in your scoring

CRITICAL: Your RESPONSE MUST BE ONLY A VALID JSON OBJECT in the following format, with no additional text before or after:

{
  "overall_score": 75,
  "confidence": 80,
  "completeness": 65,
  "accuracy": 85,
  "reasoning": "Your detailed reasoning here (3-5 sentences explaining your evaluation and justifying your scores)"
}

DO NOT include any text outside the JSON structure. The numbers above are examples - you must provide appropriate scores between 01-99.
